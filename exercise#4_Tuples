# Create a tuple with string, int, and boolean data types
my_tuple = ("apple", 1, True)

# Access elements of the tuple
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: apple
print(my_tuple[1])  # Output: 1
print(my_tuple[2])  # Output: True

# Note: Tuples are immutable, so we can't modify an element of the tuple
# my_tuple[0] = "banana"  # This would raise a TypeError
